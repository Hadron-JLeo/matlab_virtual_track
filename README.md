# Solution for Matlab Project Nr. 171

[MATLAB Simulink Challenge Projects](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/tree/main/projects/3D%20Virtual%20Test%20Track%20for%20Autonomous%20Driving)



## Possible TODOs for the Virtual Test Track



- Both highway and urban road elements

- Range of road grades, banking, and curvatures

- Traffic control infrastructure (signals, signage, street markings)

- Occlusions (buildings, signposts, trees, parked vehicles)

- Complex junctions (offset, oblique, 5+ legs, roundabouts, merges and splits)

- Restricted lane types (bus only, bike only, gore points)

- Pedestrian-road interfaces (crosswalks, sidewalks, “pedestrian scramble”)

- Sensor challenges (weathered lane markings, occluded signage, overpasses, foliage)

- Unprotected turns

## Update 1: 11/10/2024

I decided to base the track on a road I would often encounter in lower-Bavaria, Germany.
Its name is Oberglasschleife just shortly before the city of my University, Deggendorf.

The reason I chose it: You would drive sharply down-hill with many hard-rights and lefts, which caused many accidents in the past.

However, I will be adding signs from other countries and other traffic-control items to maximally confuse the Virtual Driving AI.

Grey: Guard Rails
Brown: Mountain

Keep in mind the curves had to be drivin within a massive decline/incline!

I am having a few issues deciding the right Height for the roads, but I think it will be solved with some more focus.
The beginning and the cross-section will likely be connected by the end (unlike the real city) just so the driver will have a functioning loop.
The entrance to the 'city' has been blocked off by cones. I have also added other vehicles to the road.
