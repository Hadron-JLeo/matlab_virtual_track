# Solution for Matlab Project Nr. 171

[MATLAB Simulink Challenge Projects](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/tree/main/projects/3D%20Virtual%20Test%20Track%20for%20Autonomous%20Driving)



## Possible TODOs for the Virtual Test Track



- Both highway and urban road elements

- Range of road grades, banking, and curvatures

- Traffic control infrastructure (signals, signage, street markings)

- Occlusions (buildings, signposts, trees, parked vehicles)

- Complex junctions (offset, oblique, 5+ legs, roundabouts, merges and splits)

- Restricted lane types (bus only, bike only, gore points)

- Pedestrian-road interfaces (crosswalks, sidewalks, “pedestrian scramble”)

- Sensor challenges (weathered lane markings, occluded signage, overpasses, foliage)

- Unprotected turns
